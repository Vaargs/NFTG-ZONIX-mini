# NFTG-ZONIX

NFTG-ZONIX is a Telegram-native Web3 platform that transforms a pixel grid into a visual and interactive catalog of Telegram channels.

Inspired by the Million Dollar Homepage concept and adapted for the Telegram + TON ecosystem, the project turns each pixel (or group of pixels) into an interactive block linked to a real Telegram channel. Users can purchase pixels, upload an image, and add a link and description for their channel — creating a vibrant visual showcase of Telegram communities, directly inside a Telegram Mini App.

✅ Telegram Mini App (already functional)  
🌐 Web catalog (in development) — with advanced search, filters, and categories  
🔗 TON Connect integration (already functional)  
🖼️ Image editor with multi-select and link attachment  
🛡️ Manual moderation of images and links to prevent abuse

## 🧠 Created by myself with AI support

This MVP was created entirely by myself - without a team. I don't even know programming languages, I only had an idea and a vision and neural networks like GPT, Claude and others.

## 📘 How to Use the App

Before you begin, you must connect your TON wallet from the main menu (accessed via the three-bar menu at the top right).

There are 4 interaction modes:

1. **View Mode** – Allows you to see who owns each cell and view the associated channel info by clicking a pixel.
2. **Single Purchase Mode** – Click on a free cell to buy it using the green button.
3. **Multi-Purchase Mode** – Allows you to select and purchase multiple pixels at once.
4. **Editor Mode** – Divided into:
   - **Image Editor** – Upload your image by clicking your purchased pixel area.
   - **Info Editor** – Edit the link to the channel, its tag name, description, and category.

### Main Menu (Hamburger):

1. **Channel Navigator** – Search for channels by category, name, and other filters.  
2. **Submit Channel** – Submit your channel to the base (non-grid listing).  
3. **Market** – (Coming soon) For pixel NFT resale and trade.  
4. **TON Wallet** – Required for pixel purchases.  
5. **Website** – Link to the project's website (currently in development).
