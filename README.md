# 🧩 NFTG-ZONIX

**NFTG-ZONIX** is a Telegram-native Web3 platform that transforms a pixel grid into a visual and interactive catalog of Telegram channels.

> “NFTG-ZONIX is not just another Mini App — it's a visual traffic hub for Telegram channels, powered by TON.”

Inspired by the *Million Dollar Homepage* concept and adapted for the Telegram + TON ecosystem, the project turns each pixel (or group of pixels) into an interactive block linked to a real Telegram channel.

Users can purchase pixels, upload an image, and add a link and description for their channel — creating a vibrant visual showcase of Telegram communities, directly inside a Telegram Mini App.

This MVP was built **entirely solo** using AI tools like GPT and Claude. I had no prior coding skills — just an idea, a clear vision, and determination.
