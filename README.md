# 🧩 NFTG-ZONIX

**NFTG-ZONIX** is a Telegram-native Web3 platform that transforms a pixel grid into a visual and interactive catalog of Telegram channels.

Inspired by the [Million Dollar Homepage] and adapted for Telegram and the TON ecosystem, this project turns each pixel (or group of pixels) into an interactive block linked to a real Telegram channel.

Users can purchase pixels, upload an image, and assign a channel link and description — creating a living visual showcase directly inside a Telegram Mini App.
